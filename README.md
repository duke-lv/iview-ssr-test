# iView SSR Test Project

> iView SSR test based on nuxt framework.

## Notice

### 2017.07.15
We've updated Vue version of this project to 2.4.1.

### 2017.07.12
Please clone the current iview repo (https://github.com/iview/iview.git) then build the latest version of iview by executing `npm run dist`.
After building, please replace `iview.js` in `node_modules/iview/dist/` with the file you built. It's in `dist/`
